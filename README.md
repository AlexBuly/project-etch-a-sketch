# project-etch-a-sketch
This is Project Etch-a-sketch. The user can "draw" within a grid of square divs by hovering their mouse over the squares. The page loads a default 16x16 grid. 

The number of squares within the grid can be controlled using a button above the grid. The button uses a prompt to input one number for both rows and columns. For example if the user types 10, there will be 10 rows and 10 columns, with a total of 100 individual squares.The highest number a user can input is 100, for a total of 10,000 inividual squares. If the user input is invalid, an alert will pop up saying so and then once ok is clicked, the grid returns to the default 16x16 grid. 

The project also contains a button that changes the squares back to white by hovering over them, a button that turns all the squares white at once when clicked, and a button used to "draw" once again by hovering, which is the same as the default behavior.
